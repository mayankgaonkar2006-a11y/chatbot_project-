\section{Updated Code: Improved Response Generation and Accuracy}
The updated code includes improvements to the chatbot's response generation and accuracy. The changes involve optimizing the NLP model and adding more training data.

\subsection{How it Works}
The updated code uses a more advanced NLP model to classify user input into different intents and generate responses. The model is trained on a larger dataset of intents and responses, allowing the chatbot to generate more accurate and context-specific responses.

\subsubsection{Code Explanation}
The updated code includes the following changes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improved intent recognition: The chatbot uses a more advanced machine learning model to classify user input into different intents.
    \item Increased accuracy: The chatbot generates more accurate responses based on the recognized intent.
\end{itemize}
